Ani Khachatryan - Project 1
The program is finding the upper and lower bounds correctly. I am currently 
finishing the user input portion of the code. Even though some lines in my methods 
look long, they do not pass 80 characters. The only problem with formatting might be 
that my main method in Driver 1 might be a bit too long.
