Ani Khachatryan - Project 1
The program is finding the upper and lower bounds 
correctly. It is taking the user input and
determining whether that input is inside or outside 
the convex hull/boundaries correctly. Even though some of 
the lines in my methods look long, they do not 
pass 80 characters. My methods may also look long, but
they do not pass 30 lines.
