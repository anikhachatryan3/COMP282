Ani Khachatryan - Project 2

The program works as required. It compiles/runs and it gives the correct 
output. Each line also does not surpass 80 characters, and each method
does not surpass 30 lines. However, when I enter numbers like 11 and above, 
it starts to take a long time to get the output, but it does give an output.
I have tested numbers bigger than 10, and it takes a fairly long time to get 
the output, but it does end up giving the output after waiting. 
Note: the bigger the entered number, the longer it takes.
