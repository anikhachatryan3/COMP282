Ani Khachatryan - Project 2

The program works as required. It compiles/runs and it gives the correct 
output. Each line also does not surpass 80 characters, and each method
does not surpass 30 lines. However, when I enter 11 and above, it gets 
stuck for some reason. I tried many things to fix it, but it either takes 
a long time or it gets stuck.
